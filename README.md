# Task-Tracker

Since we're using JSONPlaceholder (a fake API) for demonstration, let me provide you with some test credentials 
Email: Sincere@april.biz
Password: test123


Email: Shanna@melissa.tv
Password: test123


For Registration:
Since JSONPlaceholder doesn't actually store new users (it's a mock API), you can use any email and password combination

Name: Your Name,
Email: test@example.com,
Password: password123

Here are all the existing test users in JSONPlaceholder you can try:
1. Sincere@april.biz
2. Shanna@melissa.tv
3. Nathan@yesenia.net
4. Julianne.OConner@kory.org
5. Lucio_Hettinger@annie.ca
